                                Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! When you use our store services, you trust us with
                                your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we
                                collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. When you share information with us,
                                we can make our services even better for you. For instance, we can show you more
                                relevant search results and ads, help you connect with people or to make sharing with
                                others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re
                                using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. This is important;
                                we hope you will take time to read it carefully. Remember, you can find controls to
                                manage your information and protect your privacy and security. We’ve tried to keep it as
                                simple as possible.

                                safeguard the security and privacy of personal data, and to prevent it from being
                                altered, corrupted, destroyed or accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, the

                                You can view or edit your personal data online for many of our services. You can
                                also make choices about our collection and use of your data. How you can access or
                                control your personal data will depend on which services you use. You can choose
                                whether you wish to receive promotional communications from our store by email, SMS,
                                physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from
                                us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that
                                message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone
                                calls, and postal mail by visiting and signing into Company Promotional
                                Communications Manager, which allows you to update contact information, manage

                                your contact information with our partners. These choices do not apply to mandatory
                                service communications that are part of certain store services.

                                Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences
                                with our services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a
                                personal account. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services
                                by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or
                                usage data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from third
                                parties (including other companies). For example, we supplement the data we collect
                                by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other
                                companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to
                                customize certain services to your location. The data we collect depends on the
                                services and features you use.

                            <div class="privacy__content">
                                Our store uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our business
                                and provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, to send
                                communications, including promotional communications, and to display advertising. In
                                carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various store
                                services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized
                                experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and
                                procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we
                                store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in)
                                separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your
                                name, email address or phone number.

                                We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any
                                transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we
                                share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so. When you provide
                                payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other
                                entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and
                                for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. In addition, we share personal data
                                among our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with
                                vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this
                                statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or
                                assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to
                                personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies
                                must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use
                                personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose
                                personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
